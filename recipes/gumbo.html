    <ol>
        <p><li>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, 
            heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, 
            until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; 
            watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; c
            ontinue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl 
            of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables 
            into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook 
            until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over 
            medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, 
            stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file 
            gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and 
            cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have 
            blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.
