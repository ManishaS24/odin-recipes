# odin-recipes
This is a small project a recipe site build by using basic HTML tags.

Diffrent lists/menus are created using unordered list(<ul>) and ordered list(<ol>). h1, h2 and h3 tags are used for diffrent headings, an imgage tag(<img>)
for adding image files. Different recipes are linked to the index file as separate pages.
